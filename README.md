# Northline Safety Solutions — Master Notes (written to self)

> Dump of everything built/said/half-built recently: positioning, services, niches, pricing philosophy, ops, marketing, and future ideas. This is the internal “source of truth” doc to pull from for website copy, proposals, capability statements, decks, and SOPs.

## Identity

- **Name:** Northline Safety Solutions
- **Base:** Chicago
- **Reality:** built to travel (on-site, remote, hybrid)
- **Tone:** serious + field-credible + practical. No corporate poster vibe. No tech-bro vibe.
- **Core line:** **Protect people. Protect business.**
- **Brand lanes:** Construction/Industrial and Fire/Rescue shown as equal-weight lanes with the same standard.

---

## Positioning

Northline exists for high-consequence work where schedules are tight, hazards are high-energy, conditions change constantly, and crews need clarity more than another binder.

The through-line:
- **Make risk visible**
- **Make plans executable**
- **Make performance repeatable**
- **Make response capability real (not paper)**

Northline is not “consulting” in the soft sense—this is field-ready execution + defensible documentation + the ability to mobilize when risk demands it.

---

## Who Northline serves

### Primary client types
- Construction (especially electrical / high-energy environments)
- Industrial / manufacturing / operational sites
- Multi-site organizations that need standardization across locations
- Owners/GCs/subs that need inspection readiness and tighter field behavior
- Fire departments, rescue teams, and high-risk sites that need real readiness

### What drives buying decisions
- Lower injuries/recordables and the downstream damage (cost, delays, trust loss)
- Avoid shutdowns and schedule-killers created by unmanaged risk
- Be ready for scrutiny (OSHA, owner, insurance, post-incident review)
- Have response capability that actually works when something goes sideways

---

## Service lines

### 1) Construction & Industrial Support
Strengthen safety performance on the floor and in the field.

- **Jobsite & plant leadership presence** that raises the standard with minimal production drag
- **High-risk work planning:** energized work, LOTO, confined space, lifting/rigging, SIMOPS, shutdown planning
- **Program builds & tune-ups:** practical systems people actually run (not binder programs)
- **Incident investigations:** root cause that leads to fixes crews will actually execute
- **Mock OSHA audits:** pressure-test documentation + field behavior before an inspector does
- **OSHA inspection readiness/support (non-legal):** organize facts, coach leaders, tighten documentation flow, reduce unforced errors
- **Regulatory support:** clean process, clean messaging, cleaner documentation, better field alignment
- **Training that lands:** custom-built to current skill level (no death-by-PowerPoint)
- **Standby rescue:** real capability/accountability for confined space, work at height, and shutdowns

---

### 2) Emergency Services & Response Readiness
Operational support for fire departments, rescue teams, and high-risk sites.

- **Technical rescue training:** confined space, low-angle, high-angle (practitioner-focused strategy + execution)
- **Pre-incident planning:** playbooks that match real staffing/equipment “at 2:00 a.m.”
- **Apparatus & equipment readiness:** inspection/testing/training so critical assets are reliable
- **Operational risk reduction:** defensible reasoning to justify training/staffing priorities
- **Standby rescue / response support** where risk demands it

---

### 3) Apparatus and equipment testing / inspections (EVT-driven lane)
Specialty inspection/testing work that fits “built to travel”:

- Fire apparatus testing (leveraging EVT credentials/experience)
- Aerial and ground ladder inspections
- Potential hose testing (future offering)
- Travel-based specialty inspections (fits the “deployable capability” brand)

---

### 4) Health / wellness / human performance (adjacent lane)
Expand “protect people” beyond OSHA-only:

- Wellness / PT programming as a service category (not fluffy—operationally useful)
- Wellness checks and support services (scoped)
- Mental health services concept (likely via partners/subs)

---

## Packaged offerings + delivery modes

### Delivery modes
- On-site
- Remote-first
- Hybrid
- Mobilize/deploy teams for multi-site or remote operations

### Sellable packaged units (easy to quote/sell)
- Site audit + corrective action plan (per site)
- Inspection readiness push (short sprint with clear deliverables)
- Training buildout (blended remote + on-site cadence)
- Ongoing safety management retainer (predictable revenue, scalable)
- Deployment blocks (day rate / week blocks for coverage or shutdown support)

### Blended training concept
Subscription-style training + scheduled in-person sessions (quarterly/biannual), tied to verification/tracking so it isn’t training theater.

---

## Pricing model and rules

### Anchor rate
- **$250/hr** as the headline consulting rate to normalize and justify.

### Canonical pricing menu (source of truth)
Pricing menu already built and treated as canonical going forward. Key mechanics:
- Owner billing often modeled at **$225/hr** inside menu for overhead/reinvest/reserve structure.
- Tiered client pricing for recurring services:
  - **Reactive / Standard / Proactive / Executive commitment** (Tier 1–4)
- Tiered rescuer pay rates (internal labor tiers):
  - **Tier 1:** $25/hr
  - **Tier 2:** $30–$35/hr
  - **Tier 3:** $50/hr

### Pricing principles
- Price based on outcome, risk, credibility, and mobilization—not just hours.
- Retainers and packages protect time and create predictable revenue.
- Travel-day pricing matters.
- Discounts are strategic (anchor-client logic), not automatic.

---

## Sales + commission mechanics

### Non-negotiable rule
- Pay sales and web work **per invoice paid**, not on promises.

### Lead-gen commission concept explored
- A hunter who only brings new work; retention and delivery stay in-house.
- Pricing exposure stays limited: give a simple expectation anchor (e.g., “$300/hr”) without exposing the full menu.
- Commission idea floated: **$20 per billable hour** on a transferred lead **after first invoice is paid**.

### Paying for SEO help (brother)
- Web dev paid per billable hour, but aligned to verified outcomes (invoices paid). Avoid paying for “traffic” without revenue.

---

## Operations and staffing model

### Staffing shape (future-proof)
- Owner-led delivery early
- Deployable field consultants / techs
- Contract SMEs as needed (IH, electrical safety, rescue specialties, etc.)
- Admin/ops support as soon as it stops being optional

### Specialty leadership roles floated (future-state org chart)
- Chief of Rescue Operations
- Chief Wellness Officer
- Specialized managers per service line as volume grows
- Subcontracting as a built-in tool, not a last resort

### Engagement structure
- Scoped, contract-based delivery
- Mix of one-offs + multi-site agreements + retainers
- Add-ons that upsell naturally: investigations, specialty training, standby coverage, program builds

---

## Brand kit + marketing assets

### Brand kit items planned
- Logo files: vector + transparent PNG + black/white + favicon
- Palette: hex/RGB/CMYK
- Fonts: logo/headline/body recommendations
- Usage guidelines
- Starter templates: business card, email signature, PPT/proposal header, uniform patch mockup

### Visual direction
- Serious, field-credible
- Green/cream palette
- Clean, modern layout rhythm (cards, bands, clear hierarchy)
- Construction & Fire/Rescue treated equally

---

## Website + SEO plan

### Website philosophy
- Clean, modern, mobile-first
- SEO-minded but not spammy
- Real images, credible tone
- Copy that works for leadership and crews without pandering to either

### Content blocks in motion
- Industry/service landing pages (construction/industrial, fire/rescue)
- Credibility sections (capability, readiness, travel, methodology)
- Lead capture (Google Forms now; can upgrade later)
- Careers funnel
- Case studies / proof once available

### SEO targets (core search intent)
- Mock OSHA audit
- OSHA inspection readiness / inspection support (non-legal)
- Standby rescue (confined space / fall protection)
- Confined space rescue training
- Rope rescue / technical rescue training
- Industrial safety support / construction safety support
- Chicago-based + built-to-travel positioning

---

## Half-developed ideas & future product concepts

### Client dashboard / tracker (retainer accelerator)
A lightweight system for:
- audit results
- corrective actions
- training records
- readiness scorecards  
Useful for retainers and multi-site standardization; also creates proof over time.

### Standardized audit product (productized service)
Repeatable audit template + scoring + corrective action playbook. Easy to sell, deliver, and scale. Feeds directly into retainer upsell.

### Fire-safe dog crate product concept (separate innovation track)
Concept: fire-safe crate that unlocks automatically during a fire.
- Option A: Bluetooth smoke detector replacement that triggers crate lock
- Option B: crate-mounted smoke detector that triggers lock directly
Goal: affordable components + realistic sourcing.

---

## Near-term roadmap + goals

- Build consulting business to **15–20 billable hours/week at $250/hr** within ~8 months
- Grow marketing presence: website, cards, branding, org structure, pamphlets, social profiles
- Start advertising aggressively once separation from full-time work is complete
- By Aug 2026: maintain ~15 consulting hours/week and consider part-time hires
- Long-term: scale to operate without constant owner presence while maintaining quality

---

## Differentiators (keep repeating, keep proving)

- Field credibility: built around high-consequence environments and real constraints
- Practical execution: plans that survive schedule pressure and human reality
- Calm under pressure: inspections/incidents/high-risk ops handled cleanly
- Training that respects the work: custom to current skill, time isn’t wasted
- Response readiness is real: capability that holds up when it’s urgent, not just on paper
- Built to travel: deployable capability is part of the identity

---

## Open decisions / holes to fill

- Final packaging: which offerings get fixed “starter packages” vs fully custom
- Which service lines lead the brand (construction vs rescue vs apparatus) depending on target market
- Minimum viable “dashboard” (how simple can it be and still be valuable)
- Proof library plan: how to capture case studies, metrics, testimonials without being corny
- Partnership map: which SMEs get standardized subcontract agreements first
