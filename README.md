## Overview

Northline Safety Solutions helps organizations protect their people and protect their bottom line—without turning the job into a paperwork contest.

We provide risk management, safety, health, and emergency response consulting for construction, industrial, and operational environments. This work lives in the real world: tight schedules, changing conditions, high-energy hazards, and crews that need clear direction more than another binder.

Our services are delivered on a scoped, contract basis and built to travel—focused on protecting people, reducing risk, and keeping the job moving. If you’re trying to keep recordables down, reduce unforced errors during inspections, or make sure response capability actually works when something goes sideways, this is exactly what we do.

## What We Do

### Construction & Industrial Support
*Strengthening safety performance on the floor and in the field.*

- **Jobsite & Plant Leadership:** Presence that raises the standard with minimal slowing of production.
- **High-Risk Work Planning:** Energized work, LOTO, confined space, lifting/rigging, SIMOPS, shutdown planning.
- **Program Builds & Tune-Ups:** Practical, field-usable programs (not binder programs).
- **Incident Investigations:** Root cause analysis that produces solutions crews can actually execute.
- **Mock OSHA Audits:** Pressure-test documentation and field behavior before an inspector does.
- **OSHA Inspection Readiness (Non-Legal):** Process coaching, documentation flow, leadership prep, and reducing unforced errors.
- **Regulatory Support:** Organize facts, coach messaging, and improve on-site execution so inspections are calmer and cleaner.
- **Training That Lands:** Custom-built for supervisors and crews at their current level (no death-by-PowerPoint).
- **Standby Rescue:** Real capability and accountability for confined space, work at height, and shutdowns.

### Emergency Services & Response Readiness
*Operational support for Fire Departments, rescue teams, and high-risk sites.*

- **Technical Rescue Training:** Practitioner-focused strategy for confined space, low-angle, and high-angle rescue—built around your district/site hazards and current skill level (no death-by-PowerPoint).
- **Pre-Incident Planning:** Playbooks that fit the staffing and equipment you actually have at 2:00 a.m.
- **Apparatus & Equipment Readiness:** Inspection, testing, and training to keep critical assets reliable.
- **Operational Risk Reduction:** Help chiefs/officers justify training and staffing priorities with defensible reasoning.
- **Standby Rescue / Response Support:** Team support and capability where risk demands it.

## How We Work

- **Start with reality:** Verify conditions in the field, then build what people can actually run.
- **Make risk visible:** Identify the “unknown unknowns” early—before they become injuries, shutdowns, or bad decisions.
- **Make plans executable:** Clear steps, clear roles, and clean documentation that matches how work happens.
- **Keep it calm under pressure:** Inspections, incidents, or high-risk operations—tight process and no unforced errors.
- **Scope and deliverables stay clean:** Contract-based work, clear deliverables, no mystery add-ons.

## Past Performance & Differentiators

Better planning and cleaner execution reduce the things that hurt people—and the downstream consequences that come with it.

Northline is built for travel. We make risk visible, plans executable, and performance repeatable.

- **Real World Focus:** No time wasted on theory—focus on what works under stress and under schedule pressure.
- **Customized Training:** Start from current competency so time isn’t wasted learning what people already know.
- **Defensible Strategy:** The “why” is clear—and the documentation supports it.
- **Field credibility:** Built around high-consequence environments: construction, industrial operations, and emergency response work.

> “If you’re thinking, ‘This would help my people and keep us out of trouble,’ you’re exactly right.”
