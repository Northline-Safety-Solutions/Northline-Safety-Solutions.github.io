<summary>## Hero</summary>

- Headline: High-consequence work. Real-world execution.
- Subhead: Protecting people and businesses.

  - Northline keeps safety and response practical—systems that crews can run, training that sticks, and standby/technical rescue that’s real when the risk is high. It brings clarity and consistency you can stand behind, without turning the job into a paperwork contest. Plans match reality, support respects the work, and the operation holds up when it actually gets tested.
  - Northline supports construction, industrial, and emergency services with practical safety systems, OSHA inspection readiness, standby rescue, and technical rescue training. Chicago-based and built to travel—on-site, remote, or hybrid.

<summary>## Core services</summary>

- Intro: Two lanes. Same depth. Same standard.

### Construction & industrial support
- Copy:
  - Strengthen safety performance without turning the job into a paperwork contest. The goal is simple: protect people and protect business while keeping production moving.
- Quick hits:
  - Mock OSHA audit
  - OSHA inspection readiness
  - Standby rescue (confined space / fall protection)
- Services:
  - High-risk work planning: energized work, LOTO, confined space, lifting/rigging, SIMOPS.
  - LOTO program development: procedures + verification habits that hold up under scrutiny.
  - Recordability management: recordable reduction support through coaching, prevention, and reporting discipline.
  - Incident investigations: root cause that leads to fixes crews will actually execute.
  - OSHA inspection support (non-legal): organize facts, coach leadership, run interference on process and documentation.
  - On-site safety training: custom, crew-level, and practical (no death-by-PowerPoint).

### Fire / rescue & response readiness
- Copy:
  - Capability that works under stress—whether you’re training a team, validating apparatus readiness, or supporting high-risk operations. Built for chiefs, officers, and the people who are actually going in.
- Quick hits:
  - Fire apparatus & equipment inspection/testing
  - Custom technical rescue training
  - Standby rescue team contractor
- Services:
  - Confined space rescue training: practitioner-focused strategy and execution.
  - Rope rescue training: low-angle and high-angle operations with real-world constraints.
  - Technical rescue instructor support: build a training plan that matches your district’s hazards.
  - Pre-incident planning: playbooks that fit staffing and equipment you actually have at 2:00 a.m.
  - Apparatus & equipment readiness: inspection/testing/training so critical assets are reliable.
  - Remote fire department consulting: planning, review, and coaching.

<summary>## Company overview</summary>

- Header: Direct support. Clean documentation. Field-ready execution.
- Copy:
  - Northline delivers risk management, safety, health, and emergency-response consulting for construction, industrial, and operational environments. We work where conditions change fast and consequences are real—tight schedules, high-energy hazards, and crews that need clarity more than another binder.
- How we work:
  - We scope the problem fast, verify in the field, then build systems that crews actually use. Many projects start remote (review + plan + training design) and move on-site only where it matters.
- What changes:
  - Risk becomes visible: the “unknown unknowns” get identified early.
  - Execution gets cleaner: fewer surprises, fewer near misses, fewer shutdowns.
  - Decisions get defensible: especially during inspections, incidents, and audits.
</details>

<details>
<summary>## Custom pricing</summary>

- Header: Scoped, contract-based, and built around your hazards and schedule.
- Line: Every package is priced custom
- Copy:
  - Some clients need a fast inspection-readiness push. Others need on-site coverage, standby rescue, or a training buildout. You get a clean scope, clear deliverables, and no mystery add-ons.
  - If budget is tight, we can often reduce cost by starting remote (review + planning + training design), then deploying on-site only where it has the most impact.
- Fast next step:
  - Tell us what you’re dealing with. We’ll respond directly and propose the simplest plan that actually reduces risk.

<summary>## Why Northline</summary>

- Header: High standards, calm execution, and credibility in the field.

### Real-world focus
- We don’t build “binder programs.” We build plans that survive schedule pressure, changing conditions, and human reality. The target is fewer injuries, fewer shutdowns, and fewer bad surprises.

### Training that lands
- Training is custom to current skill level so time isn’t wasted—and gaps get addressed directly. Practical, direct, and built around what your people actually do.

### Inspection-ready support
- Mock OSHA audits and OSHA inspection readiness that improves field behavior and documentation flow. If an inspector shows up, you want a calm process—organized facts, tight messaging, and no unforced errors.

### Worth mobilizing
- Chicago-based doesn’t mean Chicago-only. When travel is required, the goal is to protect people and protect business by eliminating preventable risk where it matters most.

  - “If you’re thinking this helps your people and keeps you out of trouble — you’re right.”
