## Identity

- **Name:** Northline Safety Solutions
- **Base:** Chicago
- **Operating reality:** built to travel (on-site, remote, hybrid)
- **Tone:** serious, field-credible, practical. No corporate poster vibe. No tech-bro vibe.
- **Core line:** **Protect people. Protect business.**
- **Brand lanes:** Construction/Industrial and Fire/Rescue shown as equal-weight lanes with the same standard.

---

## Positioning

Northline exists for high-consequence work where schedules are tight, hazards are high-energy, conditions change constantly, and crews need clarity more than another binder.

The through-line:
- **Make risk visible**
- **Make plans executable**
- **Make performance repeatable**
- **Make response capability real (not paper)**

Northline is not “consulting” in the soft sense—this is field-ready execution + defensible documentation + the ability to mobilize when risk demands it.

---

## Billing anchors (internal)

- **Standard billing rate:** **$300/hr**
- **First-time client discount floor:** as low as **$225/hr** when strategically necessary (intro pricing, de-risking entry, or landing a retainer)
- Discounts are intentional, not automatic—used to open the door or secure predictable work.

---

## Who Northline serves

### Primary client types
- Construction (especially electrical / high-energy environments)
- Industrial / manufacturing / operational sites
- Multi-site organizations needing standardization across locations
- Owners/GCs/subs needing inspection readiness and tighter field behavior
- Fire departments, rescue teams, and high-risk sites needing real readiness

### What drives buying decisions
- Lower injuries/recordables and the downstream damage (cost, delays, trust loss)
- Avoid shutdowns and schedule-killers created by unmanaged risk
- Be ready for scrutiny (OSHA, owner, insurance, post-incident review)
- Have response capability that actually works when something goes sideways

---

## Skills inventory (what Northline can credibly sell)

### Field leadership + safety systems
- High-risk task planning under schedule pressure
- Practical program design (simple enough to run, strong enough to defend)
- Leading indicators + corrective action systems that don’t become admin bloat
- Investigation interviews, scene documentation, causal analysis, and action tracking
- Crew-facing safety influence without losing credibility (practical and direct)

### High-energy hazards + electrical emphasis
- Energized work planning mindset (energy control, verification habits, human factors)
- Lockout/Tagout program design + verification discipline
- SIMOPS planning and risk controls that actually survive in the field
- High-risk planning around lifting/rigging and shutdown coordination

### OSHA / regulatory readiness (non-legal)
- Mock inspections and readiness sprints
- Documentation triage: what matters, what doesn’t, how to tighten the flow
- Leadership coaching for inspector interactions (process + composure + organization)
- Unforced-error reduction: fix the easy misses before they become expensive

### Training & instruction (operator-level)
- Instructor mindset: training built for retention, not attendance
- Skill-based progression (start at current level; stop wasting time)
- Practical delivery formats: toolbox talks, crew training, supervisor development, scenario-based drills
- Written plans, checklists, and “field cards” that make training stick

### Emergency response + rescue readiness
- Confined space rescue strategy + execution
- Rope rescue / low-angle / high-angle concepts and operational constraints
- Pre-incident planning that matches real staffing/equipment “at 2:00 a.m.”
- Standby rescue planning and accountability expectations for high-risk operations

### Apparatus / equipment readiness lane (EVT-driven)
- Fire apparatus inspection/testing experience and deployment mindset
- Aerial/ground ladder inspection concepts (as scoped)
- Equipment reliability framing: critical assets must be dependable, not “probably fine”

### Operational credibility (general)
- Built for travel and work across regions (deployable capability)
- Comfortable in high-consequence environments and time pressure
- Calm process under scrutiny (inspections, incidents, high-risk operations)

---

## Service lines

### 1) Construction & Industrial Support
Strengthen safety performance on the floor and in the field.

- **Jobsite & plant leadership presence** that raises the standard with minimal production drag
- **High-risk work planning:** energized work, LOTO, confined space, lifting/rigging, SIMOPS, shutdown planning

- **Incident investigations:** root cause that leads to fixes crews will actually execute
- **Mock OSHA audits:** pressure-test documentation + field behavior before an inspector does
- **OSHA inspection readiness/support (non-legal):** organize facts, coach leaders, tighten documentation flow, reduce unforced errors
- **Regulatory support:** clean process, clean messaging, cleaner documentation, better field alignment
- **Training that lands:** custom-built to current skill level (no death-by-PowerPoint)
- **Standby rescue:** real capability/accountability for confined space, work at height, and shutdowns

---

### 2) Emergency Services & Response Readiness
Operational support for fire departments, rescue teams, and high-risk sites.

- **Technical rescue training:** confined space, low-angle, high-angle (practitioner-focused strategy + execution)
- **Pre-incident planning:** playbooks that match real staffing/equipment “at 2:00 a.m.”
- **Apparatus & equipment readiness:** inspection/testing/training so critical assets are reliable

---

### 3) Apparatus and equipment testing / inspections (EVT-driven lane)
Specialty inspection/testing work that fits “built to travel”:

- Fire apparatus testing (leveraging EVT credentials/experience)
- Aerial and ground ladder inspections
- Potential hose testing (future offering)
- Travel-based specialty inspections (deployable capability)

---

### 4) Health / wellness / human performance (adjacent lane)
Expand “protect people” beyond OSHA-only:

- Wellness / PT programming as a service category (operationally useful, not fluffy)
- Wellness checks and support services (scoped)
- Mental health support concept (likely via partners/subs)

---

## Packaged offerings + delivery modes

### Delivery modes
- On-site
- Remote-first
- Hybrid
- Mobilize/deploy teams for multi-site or remote operations

### Productized / packaged units (easy to quote/sell)
- **Site audit + corrective action plan** (per site)
- **Inspection readiness push** (short sprint with clear deliverables)
- **Training buildout** (blended remote + on-site cadence)
- **Retainer-based safety leadership support** (predictable revenue, scalable)
- **Deployment blocks** (day/week coverage for shutdowns, high-risk phases, or response support)

### Blended training concept
Subscription-style training + scheduled in-person sessions (quarterly/biannual), tied to verification/tracking so it isn’t training theater.

---

## Retainer packages (no pricing here)

> Retainers are structured by intensity: “reactive support” → “embedded partner” → “executive-level commitment.” Packages stay clean and defendable; scope creep is controlled.

## Staffing model (internal labor tiers)

> Used for scaling delivery without losing quality. Clear internal bands.

- **Tech 1:** **$22–$28/hr** (entry-level field support, logistics, basic observations, admin support on-site)
- **Tech 2:** **$28–$40/hr** (competent field tech, can run standard tasks, supports audits/training delivery, assists investigations)
- **Tech 3:** **$40–$65/hr** (senior tech/specialist, can lead field functions, train, support rescue operations, handle higher-risk tasks)

*Owner-led delivery remains the standard for high-stakes engagements; tech tiers expand capacity.*

---

## Operations and delivery mechanics

- **Scoped, contract-based delivery** with clean deliverables and clean change control
- **Remote-first when it saves time/cost**, on-site when it matters
- **Proof and defensibility baked in:** clear records of decisions, hazards, controls, and follow-through

## Half-developed ideas & future product concepts

### Client dashboard / tracker (retainer accelerator)
Lightweight system for:
- audit results
- corrective actions
- training records
- readiness scorecards  
Useful for retainers and multi-site standardization; also creates proof over time.

### Standardized audit product (productized service)
Repeatable audit template + scoring + corrective action playbook. Easy to sell, deliver, and scale. Feeds directly into retainer upsell.

### Fire-safe dog crate product concept (separate innovation track)
Fire-safe crate that unlocks automatically during a fire.
- Option A: Bluetooth smoke detector replacement triggers crate lock
- Option B: crate-mounted smoke detector triggers lock directly
Goal: affordable components + realistic sourcing.

---

## Differentiators (repeat + prove)

- Field credibility in high-consequence environments
- Practical execution: plans survive schedule pressure and human reality
- Calm under pressure: inspections/incidents/high-risk ops handled cleanly
- Training that respects the work: custom to current skill, no wasted time
- Response readiness is real: capability that works when urgent, not just on paper
- Built to travel: deployable capability is part of identity

---

## Open decisions / holes to fill

- Final packaging: what becomes fixed “starter packages” vs fully custom
- Which lane leads the brand by market (construction vs rescue vs apparatus)
- Minimum viable dashboard (simple but valuable)
- Proof library plan: metrics, testimonials, case studies without being corny
- Partnership map: which SMEs get standardized subcontract agreements first
